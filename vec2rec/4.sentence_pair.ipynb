    "# Similarity Classification Using Sentence Pair Comparison with RoBERTa\n",
    "We have generated the labelled dataset from the previous notebook create_label.ipynb.\n",
    "<br>The datasets are split into training set and the validation set and put into variables train_df and eval_df respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "[simpletransformer](https://simpletransformers.ai/) is a wrapper to Huggingface's transformer library which helps to standardize many of the training tasks and has a nice integration with Wegihts and Bias (WandB) visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of finding the candidate from the resume is essentially [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/) task [Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)]\n",
    "\n",
    "In here I am using the **ClassificationModel** with _regression=**True**_ which is suitable for providing a single value, in this case the similarity of two sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the original BERT for the pretrained model, I chose RoBERTa which uses the same engine but a different training method and more training time.\n",
    "<br>It performs reasonably well even with a trimmed-down training/eval set to allow this runnable for the project submission.\n",
    "<br>Comparatively, the original BERT base pretrained model (bert-base-cased) has a limited pretrained vocab and left lots of tokens marked as unknown \\[UNK\\]. Instead of using the BERT large I have picked the RoBERTa base (roberta-base) instead, which has a vocab of over 50k and covered most of the words used."

I developed an ML model to identify Santander Customer Transaction EDA and Prediction using 10 different features (MSE,RMSE , R2 score, skew and kurtosis etc.) of the cell in question and after that, I did some work on three different model, train a model and predict the target value for the test set, then prepare a submission.– Training's auc: (0.951424) and CV score:( 0.90022 ).   \n",
